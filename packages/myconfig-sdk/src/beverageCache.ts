/*
 * This file is the point where "V1 beverages" become just "beverages".
 * The outside consumer doesn't know or care whether we're using V1 or something else:
 * from here on the exposed typings are what matters.
 *
 * We only support Beverages V1 right now, so no need to do anything special when initializing or interacting
 * with it. If we were to add a Beverages V2, we could split/combine versions for both of them here.
